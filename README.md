# Password Generator - Optimized Code

Welcome to the Optimized Password Generator! This Python script has been improved for readability, efficiency, and ease of use. 
The script still enables users to generate random passwords based on specified length and character requirements, but with enhanced coding practices.

## How to Use:

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the desired password length.
3. Specify the number of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters as prompted.
4. The script will generate and display a random password that meets the specified criteria.

## Improvements:

1. **Reduced Redundancy:**
   - Character sets are obtained using the `string` module, reducing redundancy.

2. **Simplified Password Generation:**
   - The password generation process is simplified using a single loop and the `random.sample` method.

3. **Improved Readability:**
   - The code is more concise and easier to read.

4. **Enhanced User Input Handling:**
   - Improved error handling ensures that the sum of character counts matches the specified password length.
